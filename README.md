# Blockchain Agency Project

# Welcome to my GitHub repository! In this project, I have developed a cutting-edge web site for a blockchain agency. Harnessing the power of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5, I have crafted a sleek and intuitive user interface to enhance the user experience.

# Responsive design,, optimized layouts, and incorporated modern UI components to create a visually stunning and engaging application.

# Throughout the development process, I utilized the industry-standard tools like Zeplin and Git, which facilitated seamless collaboration and efficient version control. This ensured smooth teamwork and helped maintain the project's integrity.

# Feel free to explore the deployed application by clicking on the rocket logo below. You can also clone the repo, using git clone, and start it in your own machine.

Have fun.
